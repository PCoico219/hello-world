# hello-world

Hello everyone who cares,

If you've made it this far into this random README, I love you! 
No, I'm not buying you dinner. Yes, you can hang out with me...
I'm just a basic full-time college student who likes to code 
and make funny, stupid, and sometimes horribly sarcastic
remarks.

Let's have some fun!

Sin-sear-ly,
Patrick
